# Improved Scaffolding

This datapack for 1.19.3 by PearUhDox improves Scaffolding behavior, allowing it to be more flexible and versatile.

When installed, the following changes apply to all Scaffolding.

- Scaffolding is easier to place upwards when trying to pillar or in general.
(When attempting to pillar up with Scaffolding, the block will place like traditional blocks rather than using the Scaffolding block ruleset.)

- Scaffolding will place a birch trapdoor when it would have fallen, allowing for infinite travel horizontally.
(These trapdoors will vanish when they are broken by a tool, and will also vanish when the scaffolding is reclaimed)

- Scaffolding items will teleport to the player who is breaking the Scaffolding (when within 50 blocks)

- Players can travel faster up and down Scaffolding. The traveler is also aligned with the center of the Scaffold so it is harder to fall out.

- Players get brief Slow Falling (1 second) while traveling up or down if they fall out.
